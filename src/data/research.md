# Research

My research program focuses on developing novel computational approaches to solve complex problems in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and quantum computing. I lead the Intelligent Systems Laboratory at the University of Technology, where we explore the theoretical foundations and practical applications of these technologies.

## Current Research Areas

### Quantum Machine Learning

We are developing new algorithms that leverage quantum computing principles to enhance machine learning capabilities. Our recent work focuses on quantum neural networks and quantum-enhanced optimization for training deep learning models. Key projects include:

- **Quantum Variational Autoencoders**: Developing quantum versions of variational autoencoders that can process high-dimensional data more efficiently than classical counterparts.
- **Quantum Reinforcement Learning**: Exploring how quantum algorithms can accelerate reinforcement learning tasks in complex environments.

### Ethical AI and Fairness

My lab is deeply committed to addressing the ethical challenges in AI development and deployment. We are working on:

- **Interpretable AI Systems**: Building models that provide transparent explanations for their decisions and recommendations.
- **Algorithmic Fairness**: Developing techniques to detect and mitigate bias in machine learning systems, with a focus on applications in healthcare and criminal justice.
- **Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning**: Creating methods for training models on sensitive data while preserving individual privacy.

### Distributed AI Systems

We are pioneering approaches for deploying AI in distributed environments:

- **Federated Learning at Scale**: Enhancing federated learning techniques to work effectively across heterogeneous devices and networks.
- **Edge AI Optimization**: Developing lightweight models and optimization techniques for AI deployment on edge devices with limited computational resources.
